# Frequently Asked Questions

If your question is not listed below

## Why `lorebooks.wiki` and not `lorebooks.community` (or even `lores.community`?)

Not only to match with our GitHub organization namespace, but it boils down to the
cost of domain renewals (the `.community` TLD costs 25.18 USD while `.wiki` costs
19.18 USD[^1]).

## How can I donate to keep this thing up?

Right now, @ajhalili2006 currently accepts donations through his GitHub Sponsors
page, [among other means](https://sponsors.andreijiroh.xyz)

[^1]: The cost of domain registrations and renewals are based on data from Cloudflare Registrar. While Andrei Jiroh brought the domain on Porkbun through [Hack Club Arcade Shop](https://hackclub.com/arcade/shop) for the first year discount price of 2.04 USD, that shoots to 20.06 USD on renewal.
