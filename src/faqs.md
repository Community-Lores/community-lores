# Frequently Asked Questions

We maintain this page to answer frequently asked questions we may expect to receive
soon in the future or answered multiple times through the issue tracker and support
requests.

If your question is not listed below, visit our [help center], search around the
[meta issue tracker] or email `contact@lorebooks.wiki`.

## General

### Why `lorebooks.wiki` and not `lorebooks.community` (or even `lores.community`?)

Not only to match with our GitHub organization namespace, but it boils down to the
cost of domain renewals (the `.community` TLD costs 28.18 USD while `.wiki` costs
19.18 USD[^1]).

If you have some deep pockets and want to bring these domains to life too, consider
[donating](./donate.md). If you also want to transfer a domain you own into the project
(or perhaps team up with us on domain admin), let us know at `sponsors@recaptime.dev`.

### How can I donate to keep this thing up?

~~Right now, @ajhalili2006 currently accepts donations through his GitHub Sponsors
page, [among other means](https://sponsors.andreijiroh.dev)~~

Since we're fiscally sponsored via HCB (Hack Club's [fiscal sponsorship program]), 
you can now [donate](./donate.md) to help us cover domain renewal fees and other
things (covering all the fees would be also great too, but we don't force anyone
to do that).

### Is this just good old subdomain service?

Nope. We'll be cooking up other documentation and wiki related projects to
Community Lorebooks in the futue, including [a community wiki for GIldedguy Stories].

### Who maintains this?

The [Recap Time Squad crew](https://recaptime.dev/team), currently running as a
one-man operation by [Andrei Jiroh](https://andreijiroh.dev).

## Acceptable Use Policy / Terms

### I use Ghost or similar open-source software with a hosted cloud offering? Are they exempted from the license restrictions?

Only if there's no difference between the self-hosted and hosted version in terms
of feature set and licensing, we will have a look onto it.

### Why I have to disclose what software I used?

Primarily for transparency but also to ensure that you don't use our subdomain service
for anything outside the non-profit/personal use.

### How do I report abuse?

See <https://support.recaptime.dev/article/10-reporting-abusive-content> for details on
how to report abuse.

[^1]: The cost of domain registrations and renewals are based on data from Cloudflare Registrar. While Andrei Jiroh brought the domain on Porkbun through [Hack Club Arcade Shop](https://hackclub.com/arcade/shop) for the first year discount price of 2.04 USD, that shoots to 20.06 USD on renewal.

## Fiscal sponsorship status

### Why HCB and not something like Open Source Collective?

Like our umbrela open-source organization, we chose to go with Hack Club's
[fiscal sponsorship program], HCB, to allow us to use their in-house platform
other open-source projects they currently fiscally sponsor to receive and
spend money transparently but with the added bonus of a 501\(c)(3) non-profit
legal status, hence receiving tax-deductible donations in the US.

Although we still use [Open Collective][oc-lb] for discoverability reasons, we
synchorize the ledger manually between HCB and Open Collective within weeks
and we redirect reimbursement and expense report submission flows to HCB to keep
things organized in one place.

### Where's your fiscal sponsorship confirmation letter and other documents?

We publish anything we can publish about our fiscal sponsorship status with HCB
in [this help center article][legal-docs-hc].
