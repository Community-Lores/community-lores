# Support the project

The Community Lorebooks project is operating as a non-profit service and open-source project
by [Recap Time Squad](https://recaptime.dev) and currently covered out of pocket by @ajhalili2006
for the domain renewal of `lorebooks.wiki` as well as the infrastructure that makes this (and
other projects) run smoothly.

!!! info "Fiscal sponsorship disclosure"
    Recap Time Squad is [fiscally sponsored](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship) by [The Hack Foundation](https://hackfoundation.org) (d.b.a. [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)), a 501\(c)(3) US nonprofit (EIN: 81-2908499).

    Have questions regarding our fiscal sponsorship status, need a invoice for your donation
    (on mailed US checks and bank deposits) or even considering corporate sponsorship or crypto donations?
    Email `sponsors@recaptime.dev` with CC to `hcb@hackclub.com`.[^1]

    If you need to reach out to someone more directly at HCB, our point of contact is Paul Spitler
    with email address `paul@hackclub.com`.

[^1]: **Why carbon copy email to the HCB team?** This way they can have the correspondence between
you and the team, especially in things like invoices.

## Donating online

The easy way to donate into the project is by donating online over at [HCB](https://hcb.hackclub.com),
Hack Club's [fiscal sponsorship platform and program](https://hackclub.com/hcb).

### Paying by invoice

You can request us to send a invoice using the form below, made with Fillout. ([Embed not loading?](https://recaptimedev.fillout.com/donation-invoice))

<div style="width:100%;height:500px;" data-fillout-id="ptbA5M64BGus" data-fillout-embed-type="standard" data-fillout-inherit-parameters data-fillout-dynamic-resize></div><script src="https://server.fillout.com/embed/v1/"></script>

If you use a invoicing system other than Stripe Invoicing or have a employee donation matching program,
please let us know using the email address above in the **Fiscal sponsorship disclosure** section.

### Bank transfers

If you choose to go through the donation invoice route, you should see our fiscal host's main bank
account details. In the memo/comment field in your bank app, write `Recap Time Squad` in it for the team
to move the funds into our balances.

Otherwise you can email us using the details in the **fiscal sponsorship disclosure** notice above to
request our restricted fund account details in [Column](https://column.com).

Once you sent them via bank transfer, send the receipt to the HCB team for validation as well as to move
it to our balances. If you are transferring money over Swift, you may be charged for correspondent fees.
Make sure to select `OUR` to cover them and ensuring that we can receive the full amount, minus the
fiscal sponsorship fees.

## US bank checks

We recommend to send us your photos of your US checks [via this form](https://recaptimedev.fillout.com/submit-us-bank-check),
so that we can virtually deposit it for you and receive funds faster.

Alternatively, if you want to mail a US bank check to us, please mail to our fiscal host's mailing address below:

```
The Hack Foundation
8605 Santa Monica Blvd #86294
West Hollywood, CA 90069
```

Learn more about how to write a US check to our fiscal host for benefit of Recap Time Squad [here](https://hcb.hackclub.com/faq#paper-check).

## Crypto and other gift donations

If you are planning to donate in crypto, stock or other form of donations,
please contact the HCB team for details, as mentioned above.

## Alternative ways to donate

### For Uberspace users

If you do use [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) and you want to donate some spare Euros for the project,
you can send them to us using the username `rtdev` (or `ajhalili` for Andrei Jiroh's personal Asteroid)
in the **Accounting** -> **Transfer** section of your Asteroid.

![Transfer Uberspace credits UI](https://cloud-hijh1ueu3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png)

Note that the credits we received there will be manually withdrawn by @ajhalili2006 on a
monthly basis before moving into our HCB balances. You can request a donation receipt by sending us
the Uberspace credit transfer receipt to us over email for confirmation.

### For donors from the Philippines

If you are donating from the Philippines and your card issuer's foreign exchange fee too high for you
or prefer to send money to a local bank, [visit Andrei Jiroh's sponsorship page] for instructions.

If you choose this route, make sure to send a copy of the bank transfer receipt from your bank/e-wallet app
to Andrei Jiroh via email at `ajhalili2006@crew.recaptime.dev` to process your donation.
