# Welcome to the Community Lorebooks!

**Community Lorebooks** (sometimes called **Community Lores**) is the home of not only
Recap Time Squad projects' documentation and wiki sites, but as a domain service for other projects
needing their own docs and wiki sites a custom (sub)domain without the pain of long domains[^1].

[Get your own subdomain for free :fontawesome-solid-paper-plane:](./docs/getting-started.md){ .md-button }
[Donate to keep this running :fontawesome-solid-hand-holding-dollar:](./donate.md){ .md-button }

## Benefits

* **Your own `.lorebooks.wiki`/`.stellapent.wiki` subdomain for your docs site or wiki** (or anything personal or non-proft purpose)
or even just your digital garden.
* **DNS records-as-code, powered by [`octodns`](https://github.com/octodns/octodns)** - No more JavaScript bloated admin dashboards, just send us a patch to [our DNS config] and you good to go (Alternatively, you can manage records via GitHub Issues flow and others soon.[^2])
* **Free redirection and parking service, powered by [proxypartylab]** - Got your own domain? Don't break links and let us
