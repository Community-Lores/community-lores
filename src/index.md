# Welcome to the Community Lorebooks!

**Community Lorebooks** (sometimes called **Community Lores**) is the home of not only
Recap Time Squad projects' documentation and wiki sites, but as a domain service for other projects needing their own
docs and wiki sites a custom (sub)domain.

[Get your own subdomain for free :fontawesome-solid-paper-plane:](./docs/getting-started.md){ .md-button }

## Benefits

* **Your own `.lorebooks.wiki` for your docs site or wiki** - Whether it is for a open-source project, a online community or even just your digital garden.
* **DNS records-as-code, powered by [`octodns`](https://github.com/octodns/octodns)** - No more JavaScript bloated admin dashboards, just send us a patch to our DNS config and you good to go.
* **Free redirection service, powered by [`proxypartylab`](https://proxyparty.lorebooks.wiki)** - Got your own domain? Don't break links and let us (or contribute) your Caddyfile configuration.
