# Community Lorebooks issue tracker

Our issue tracker for the service as a whole is at the following,
depending on the code forge you are using:

* GitHub: <https://github.com/lorebooks-wiki/meta/issues>
* sourcehut: <https://todo.sr.ht/~recaptime-dev/lorebooks-wiki>

## Looking to manage your subdomain?

We use a dedicated repository to handle these requests to avoid cluttering the
meta issue tracker.
