# Terms of Service

Effective: TBD / Last modified: TBD

This Terms of Service outlines the policies we enforce in content hosted under `lorebooks.wiki` domain service

## Hosting Policy

By claiming your `*.lorebooks.wiki` subdomain, you agree the following:

* You must share your email address or another contact method with Recap Time Squad for purposes of
receiving administrative notifications and as a point of contact in case of abuse reports.
* Your documentation or wiki website is for a non-profit/non-commerical open-source project or for
non-commerical use only.
* Any content that deem illegal under the US federal law or Philippine law are not premitted.
* If your project or community has its own domain, you must either [request to enable redirects]
in  the [proxypartylab issue tracker] or configure redirects on your own.
* Your documentation or wiki content is licensed under a free license such as [Creative Commons licenses].
If the content uses non-free third-party content, it should be used acorrding to fair use and fair dealing policies.
* If your documentation or wiki website does not use a open-source wiki software and uses a static site generator
or similar tool, these must be licensed under a [OSI-approved open-source license].
* You agree to Recap Time Squad [Community Code of Conduct](https://policies.recaptime.dev/code-of-conduct)
and your community has adopted its own code of conduct and is being actively enforced.

We reserve the right to reject requests or entirely block projects at our discretion if we think
a documentation or wiki site caused us legal harm or caused someone a life-threatening harm or if it
is abusive.

## Acceptable Use Policy

The `lorebooks.wiki` domain service is provided for the purpose of providing free subdomains to
documentation and wiki websites.  However, this does not mean they may be used for **any** purpose.
Like [the Obl.ong domain service](https://codeberg.org/oblong/conduct#acceptable-use-policy), we prohibit
use of our subdomains for any of the behaviors listed above as unacceptable, and for any of the following:

- any activities that intend to or actually generate profits for shareholders or do not act in the public interest
- any form of malware (which includes, without limitation, malicious code or software
  that may affect the operation of the Internet);
- any form of botnets, spam, or phishing;
- interfering with or disrupting servers or networks, or disobeying any requirements,
  procedures, policies, or regulation of networks;
- harming minors in any way, including the distribution of child pornographic images;
- distributing or hosting any adult content, including but not limited to, pornographic images or videos.
- impersonating any person or entity, including, but not limited to, an official, forum
  leader, guide or host, or falsely stating or otherwise misrepresenting its affiliation
  with a person or entity;
- using a domain name for activity comprising or contributing to piracy, trademark or
  copyright infringement, fraudulent or deceptive practices, counterfeiting, or other
  illegal activity;
- insighting or promoting violence against any person or groups of persons, which shall
include but is not limited to LGBTQIA+ and/or disabled persons and minorities;
- bullying, engaging in cyber bullying, or inciting others to bully;
- harassing, or encouraging others to harass or harm others;
- stalking;
- abusive intent to cause fear or threaten violence;
- hate speech (including homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia, racism, sexism, ableism,
  casteism, xenophobia, antisemitism, islamophobia, and other forms of bigotry);
- content which may be illegal under United States law;
- content containing Nazi symbolism, ideology, and the promotion thereof;
- content which claims to forbid/disavow abusive or hateful conduct, but which permits
  "respectful" "discussions" of "unpopular opinions"/"controversial views" (dessert pizza
  is an unpopular opinion, trans folks' right to live a happy life is not, and hate is hate
  regardless of how dressed-up it is);
- any other activity intended to organize, coordinate, or otherwise enable any of the above.

Registrations are prohibited to parties that are, or associated with, recognized
hate groups, or are otherwise engaged in hate speech.

This list is not comprehensive, and we reserve the right to revoke any subdomain at
any time. Recap Time Squad is not responsible for and does not actively monitor registrant's
content, and therefore, cannot guarantee that content hosted on our subdomains does
not violate this policy. Failure to enforce this policy or respond to a complaint
does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce it; nor does this policy create
any obligations to users or any third-party beneficiary rights or private rights of
action.

## Policy updates

## Reporting abusive content and behavior

email attachments, and include any proof that the content or subdomain in question is
abusive.
