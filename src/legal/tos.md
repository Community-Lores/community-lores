# Terms of Service

_**Last updated**: January 18, 2025 (effective February 1, 2025)_

This Terms of Service outlines the policies we enforce in content hosted under
`lorebooks.wiki` domain service, including our Hosting and Acceptable Use Policy. The
[Community Code of Conduct] is also part of your agreement with this ToS in terms of
community participation in Recap Time Squad's community and technical spaces.

## Hosting Policy

By claiming your `*.lorebooks.wiki` subdomain, you agree the following:

* You must share your email address or another contact method with Recap Time Squad for purposes of receiving administrative notifications and as a point of contact in case of abuse reports.
* Your website should use open-source software in both its frontend and backend code, under any [OSI-approved licenses][osi-approved].
* Your subdomain/project is for a non-profit/non-commerical open-source project or for non-commerical use only.
* Any content that deem illegal under the US federal law or Philippine law are not premitted.
* If your project or community has its own domain, you must configure redirects on your own or [use our redirection service][proxyparty].
* Your documentation or wiki content is licensed under a free license such as [Creative Commons licenses]. If the content uses non-free third-party content, it should be used acorrding to fair use and fair dealing policies in applicable judristictions. Exceptions are available for selected closed-sourced cloud services and hosted services (if that software has seperate business/enterprise editions with non-free license).
* You agree to Recap Time Squad [Community Code of Conduct] and your community has adopted its own code of conduct and is being actively enforced.

We reserve the right to reject requests or entirely block projects and websites at our discretion if we think a documentation or wiki site caused us legal harm or caused someone a life-threatening harm or if it is abusive.

The Acceptable Use Policy below clarifies our hosting policy also lists down what's not allowed that are not covered in this policy.

### Exceptions

Currently, we exempt the following docs hosting services and static site generators from the OSI-approved open-source license requirement:

* [GitBook](https://gitbook.io)
* [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish)

If yours is not in the list, [let us know](../docs/issue-tracker.md) and we'll look into it.
Note that license exceptions don't usually look at the infrastructure your project utilizes
(e.g. who's your hosting provider, what jurisdiction the legal entity in question, etc.)
since it's out of scope.

## Acceptable Use Policy

The `lorebooks.wiki` domain service is provided for the purpose of providing free
subdomains primarily to documentation and wiki websites, but we do not limit them
to anyone in the wiki communities.  However, this does not mean they may be used for
**any** purpose. Like [the Obl.ong domain service][oblong-conduct], we prohibit use of our
service for any of the behaviors listed above as unacceptable, and for any of the following:

* any activities that intend to or actually generate profits for shareholders or
  do not act in the public interest
* any form of malware (which includes, without limitation, malicious code or software
  that may affect the operation of the Internet);
* any form of botnets, spam, or phishing;
* interfering with or disrupting servers or networks, or disobeying any requirements,
  procedures, policies, or regulation of networks;
* harming minors in any way, including the distribution of child pornographic images;
* distributing or hosting any adult content, including but not limited to,
  pornographic images or videos.
* impersonating any person or entity, including, but not limited to, an official,
forum leader, guide or host, or falsely stating or otherwise misrepresenting its
  affiliation with a person or entity;
* using a domain name for activity comprising or contributing to piracy, trademark or
  copyright infringement, fraudulent or deceptive practices, counterfeiting, or other
  illegal activity;
* insighting or promoting violence against any person or groups of persons, which
  shall include but is not limited to LGBTQIA+ and/or disabled persons and minorities;
* bullying, engaging in cyber bullying, or inciting others to bully;
* harassing, or encouraging others to harass or harm others;
* stalking;
* abusive intent to cause fear or threaten violence;
* hate speech (including homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia, racism, sexism, ableism,
  casteism, xenophobia, antisemitism, islamophobia, and other forms of bigotry);
* content which may be illegal under United States law;
* content containing Nazi symbolism, ideology, and the promotion thereof;
* content which claims to forbid/disavow abusive or hateful conduct, but which permits
  "respectful" "discussions" of "unpopular opinions"/"controversial views" (dessert pizza
  is an unpopular opinion, trans folks' right to live a happy life is not, and hate is hate
  regardless of how dressed-up it is);
* any other activity intended to organize, coordinate, or otherwise enable any of the above.

Registrations are prohibited to parties that are, or associated with, recognized
hate groups, or are otherwise engaged in hate speech.

This list is not comprehensive, and we reserve the right to revoke any subdomain at
any time. Recap Time Squad is not responsible for and does not actively monitor registrant's
content, and therefore, cannot guarantee that content hosted on our subdomains does
not violate this policy. Failure to enforce this policy or respond to a complaint
does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce it; nor does this policy create
any obligations to users or any third-party beneficiary rights or private rights of
action.

## Policy updates

We may update this terms of service to improve our abuse prevention and report handling,
as well as to incorporate feedback from the community and support service improvements.

When we are implementing any policy changes for this service, you'll be notified
through your email address on file with us and through the meta issue tracker
via [this issue](https://github.com/lorebooks-wiki/meta/issues/1).

## Reporting abusive content and behavior

For reporting abusive content and subdomains (including abusive behavior), please
email `abuse@recaptime.dev`, with email attachments (or as a file link in cloud services
to minimize email size), and include any proof that the content or subdomain in question is
abusive.

## Attribution

The Acceptable Use Policy is adopted from [Obl.ong Code of Conduct][oblong-conduct],
which is loosely adapted from the [TLD policy for .gay], and includes wording from the
[queer.party] Mastodon instance about page.
