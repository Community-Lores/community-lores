# Community Lorebooks Privacy Policy

_**Last updated**: January 18, 2025 (effective February 1, 2025)_

Our subdomain hosting service's privacy policy is simple:

* [Our general Privacy Policy][general-privacy] also apply here, excluding any data privacy pratices our users of the subdomain service do.
* We only collect as minimal data as possible, and if we need to share data with other parties you will be notified and must opt-in to share said data unless it is legally required for takedown requests.
* We may update this policy as we improve this service, but will take effect at least a month after publication and notifying everyone.
* You can excerise your data privacy rights, including data deletion, by emailing `privacy@recaptime.dev` or contacting a team member directly.

## Data Collection and Retention

We only collect your name and any contact details you may provide (at least one is required,
preferrably email) for purposes of administrative and support purposes, as well as to process
your finanical and in-kind donation. We will not add your email address into our newsletter
lists for purposes of advertising or otherwise without your permission.

We will then retain your data as we need them and will delete it after use or after a year
from our records and/or backup media unless you instructed us to do so.

While we utilize web analytics to help us provide how many people visit our website and
read documentation, we will not track you outside of our own, including any third-party
websites hosted under our domain through the subdomain service.

## Cookies

We use cookies to provide you a much personalized and smooth experience through the
sign-in flow and storing preferences stored in your browser. If you clear cookies often
or use private browsing mode, you may lose customizations or sign you out of our websites.

Cloudflare uses cookies for their DDoS protection and bot detection systems to identify
authentic visitors from attackers and API abusers. The [Cloudflare Privacy Policy][cf-privacy]
and its related documentation has more details on how they use them.

## Subprocessors

Here are the list of our subprocessors we utilize in relation to this service,
alongside their privacy policies. [The main subprocessors list][main-list] is
even longer than that to include subprocessors we use internally.

* **Open Collective** - donor receipts and invoices, as well as reimbursement requests submitted outside [HCB] (the public ledger mirrors HCB's side but with additional context)
